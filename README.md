# Paint-Inventory
When I worked as an interior millwork sprayer, one of the biggest time wasters we encountered was the lack of a paint management system. The two main issues this caused was us constantly not being able to find paint as well as finding out too late that we didn't have enough paint for a job. This desktop application solves these two problems by keeping track of paint location details and the quantity of the paint. Additional searching functionality, as described below, allows a user of the application to quickly see which paints are in need of immediate restocking.
